RECOMMENDATIONS:
# Recommendations:

1. **Diversify Payment Methods**: You're exclusively using QR payments for all transactions. Consider using other payment options to take advantage of different rewards and benefits.

2. **Expand Banking Relationships**: With 100% of cash-ins coming from bank pull, consider diversifying your funding sources to reduce dependency on a single financial institution.

3. **Budget for Food Expenses**: As a "hungry foodie," create a dedicated food budget to ensure your dining and grocery expenses remain sustainable within your overall financial plan.

4. **Track Grocery Spending**: Being tagged as a "grocer" suggests regular grocery purchases. Monitor these expenses to identify potential savings opportunities and prevent food waste.

5. **Increase Transaction Frequency**: With only 3 transactions for both spending and cash-in, consider more frequent but smaller transactions to help with budgeting and expense tracking.

6. **Balance Patronage with Savings**: While supporting businesses as a "patron" is commendable, ensure this aligns with your long-term financial goals by allocating a specific portion of your budget to this purpose.
