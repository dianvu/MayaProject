        "recommendations": "# Financial Recommendations\n\nBased on your April 2025 transaction summary, here are personalized recommendations to improve your financial health:\n\n1. **Establish a Regular Cash-In Strategy**: You had no recorded cash-ins this month despite spending \u20b1264.36. Set up automatic transfers to your Maya account that align with your income schedule to ensure you're not depleting external accounts.\n\n2. **Create a Budget Tracking System**: As a \"prudent planner,\" implement a simple budget system that categorizes your Maya Shop purchases (62.32% of spending) to identify potential areas to reduce discretionary spending.\n\n3. **Build an Emergency Fund**: Aim to save at least 3-6 months of expenses. Start by setting aside 10% of your monthly income in a separate savings pocket within Maya to avoid using other credit sources.\n\n4. **Review Send Money Transactions**: Your send money transfers (37.68% of spending) represent a significant portion of outflows. Evaluate these recurring transfers to determine if they're essential or could be optimized.\n\n5. **Consider Digital Savings Tools**: As someone who is \"digital savvy,\" explore Maya's automated savings features or round-up tools that can help you build savings without changing your spending habits dramatically."
