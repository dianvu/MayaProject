Based on your April 2025 transaction summary, here are personalized recommendations to improve your financial health:

1. **Create a Budget Plan**: Your spending ($566.00) significantly exceeds your cash-in ($305.13), creating a monthly deficit of $260.87. Establish a detailed budget to track expenses and align spending with income to prevent debt accumulation.

2. **Build an Emergency Fund**: With your "lush drinker" lifestyle, consider redirecting 10-15% of your entertainment spending toward an emergency savings fund. Aim to gradually build 3-6 months of essential expenses.

3. **Diversify Income Sources**: Your cash-in relies heavily on send money transfers (72.79%). Explore additional income streams beyond mini-apps (currently 27.21%) to increase financial stability and total monthly income.

4. **Track Discretionary Spending**: As a "lush drinker," review your entertainment expenses to identify potential savings opportunities. Consider setting a specific monthly allowance for social activities while maintaining enjoyment.

5. **Automate Savings**: Set up automatic transfers of 10% of any incoming funds to a dedicated savings account before allocating money for expenses, helping to gradually improve your income-to-spending ratio.
