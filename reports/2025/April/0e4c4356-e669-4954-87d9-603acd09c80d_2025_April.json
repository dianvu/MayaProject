        "recommendations": "# Financial Recommendations\n\nBased on your transaction summary, here are personalized recommendations to improve your financial health:\n\n1. **Create a Dedicated Budget for Social Spending**: Your \"lush drinkers\" tag suggests frequent spending on drinks and social activities. Consider allocating a specific monthly budget for these expenses to prevent overspending while still enjoying your social life.\n\n2. **Increase Your Emergency Fund**: You're saving approximately 18% of your income (about $5,900 monthly), which is positive. Aim to maintain 3-6 months of expenses in an emergency fund, then direct additional savings toward investments.\n\n3. **Diversify Payment Methods**: You're exclusively using \"send money\" for transactions. Consider using credit cards with rewards programs for everyday purchases to earn cashback or points on spending you're already doing.\n\n4. **Track Spending Categories**: Your summary lacks spending breakdowns by category. Use a budgeting app to categorize expenses and identify areas where you might be overspending, particularly in discretionary categories.\n\n5. **Set Automated Savings**: Schedule automatic transfers of 20-25% of your income to a high-yield savings account or investment account immediately after receiving income to ensure consistent saving before spending."
