Try setting up an automatic transfer of 10-15% of your income to a separate savings account before spending.\\n\\n2. **Diversify your payment methods**: You rely heavily on QR payments (16 out of 22 transactions). Consider using credit cards for larger purchases to build credit history and earn rewards, while maintaining your current methods for smaller expenses.\\n\\n3. **Track your bank transfers**: You made three significant bank transfers totaling over 3,700 USD. If these are recurring expenses, evaluate if they can be reduced or optimized, as they represent nearly half of your monthly spending.\\n\\n4. **Balance mini-app spending**: While mini-apps are your primary cash-in method, ensure you\\'re not paying unnecessary fees. Compare rates across platforms to maximize your returns.\\n\\n5. **Create a monthly budget**: With your \"prudent planner\" profile, you would benefit from categorizing your spending and setting limits for each category to better align with your financial goals.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01LReAH9fanJw3qrukmLWr2y', 'model': 'claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'cache_creation_input_tokens': 0, 'cache_read_input_tokens': 0, 'input_tokens': 726, 'output_tokens': 270}, 'model_name': 'claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219'} id='run-03a4a586-4e61-45eb-877c-648bac35a550-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 726, 'output_tokens': 270, 'total_tokens': 996, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0, 'cache_creation': 0}}"
