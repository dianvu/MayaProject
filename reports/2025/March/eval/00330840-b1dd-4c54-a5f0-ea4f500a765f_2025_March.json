        "recommendations": "# Financial Recommendations\n\nBased on your transaction summary, here are personalized recommendations to improve your financial health:\n\n1. **Address Negative Cash Flow**: Your monthly spending ($11,164.61) significantly exceeds your cash-in ($6,378.88), creating a deficit of approximately $4,785.73. Immediately review your \"Send Money\" transactions (49.31% of spending) to identify necessary versus discretionary transfers and reduce this category by at least 30%.\n\n2. **Diversify Income Sources**: You're heavily reliant on bank transfers (97.94%) for cash-in. Consider developing at least one additional income stream in the next 3 months, such as a side business or investment income, to align with your \"prudent planner\" profile.\n\n3. **Establish Emergency Fund**: Set up an automatic transfer of 10% of your monthly cash-in to a separate high-yield savings account until you've accumulated 3-6 months of essential expenses.\n\n4. **Review Digital Spending**: As a \"digital savvy\" user with significant \"Maya Shop\" spending (38.15%), implement a 24-hour waiting period before making online purchases over $100 to reduce impulse buying.\n\n5. **Address Loan Management**: Your \"loan and gaming\" tag suggests potential debt. Create a debt repayment plan prioritizing high-interest loans first, and consider allocating no more than 5% of your monthly budget to gaming/entertainment."
