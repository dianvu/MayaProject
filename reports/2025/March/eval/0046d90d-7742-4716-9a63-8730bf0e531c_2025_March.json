        "recommendations": "# Financial Recommendations\n\nBased on your March 2025 transaction data, here are personalized recommendations to improve your financial health:\n\n## 1. Create a Dedicated Food Budget\nAs a \"hungry foodie,\" you're spending significantly on food-related purchases. Consider using Maya's budgeting tools to allocate a specific monthly amount for food expenses. Aim to reduce your food spending by 10-15% by cooking more meals at home and limiting food delivery services.\n\n## 2. Build an Emergency Fund\nYour spending ($11,520.57) is approximately 80% of your cash-in ($14,251.19), leaving only about 20% for savings. Work toward a 3-month emergency fund by automatically transferring 5-10% of each cash-in to a separate savings account before allocating money for expenses.\n\n## 3. Reduce Loan Dependency\nWith \"loan and gaming\" as a user tag and 16.84% of your cash-in coming from loan services, you may be relying too heavily on borrowed money. Create a debt reduction plan to decrease loan dependency by 5% each month and redirect those funds toward essential expenses.\n\n## 4. Optimize Bill Payments\nBills payments constitute 30.40% of your spending. Review your recurring subscriptions and utilities to identify potential savings. Consider negotiating rates with service providers or eliminating unused subscriptions to reduce this category by at least 10%.\n\n## 5. Track Gaming Expenses\nAs gaming appears in your user tags, ensure you're setting clear limits on entertainment spending. Allocate a specific monthly amount for gaming that doesn't exceed 5% of your total income, and use Maya's transaction categorization to monitor this spending."
