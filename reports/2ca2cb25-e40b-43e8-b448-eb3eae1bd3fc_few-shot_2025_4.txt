**3. Savings & Financial Position**
# Savings & Financial Position Analysis:
* Spending as % of Income: 108.13%
* Potential Savings: -₱40.33

Your spending exceeds your income by 8.13% this month, resulting in a negative savings position. This indicates you're spending slightly more than you're bringing in, which could gradually deplete your reserves if continued. As someone in the "prudent planners" segment, you may want to review your spending patterns, particularly the larger send money transactions which make up a significant portion of your expenses. Consider adjusting your budget to bring expenses below income and restore a positive savings rate.

**4. Recommendations**
# Recommendations:

1. **Balance Your Budget**: Your spending exceeds your income by 8.13%. Create a monthly budget that aligns with your actual income to maintain financial stability.

2. **Diversify Cash-In Methods**: 100% of your income comes from mini apps. Consider adding more stable income sources to reduce dependency on a single channel.

3. **Track Send Money Transactions**: With 62.5% of your spending via send money, categorize these transfers by purpose to better understand where your money is going.

4. **Analyze QR Payment Patterns**: Review your frequent QR payments (24.5% of spending) to identify any unnecessary recurring expenses that could be reduced.

5. **Build an Emergency Fund**: As a prudent planner, work toward saving 3-6 months of essential expenses to strengthen your financial security.

6. **Review Gaming Expenses**: Since you're in the "loan and gaming" segment, monitor your gaming-related spending to ensure it remains a reasonable portion of your budget.
