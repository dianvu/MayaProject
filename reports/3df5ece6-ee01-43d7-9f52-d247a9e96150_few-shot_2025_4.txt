Your spending represents 88.96% of your income this month, allowing for an 11.04% savings rate. While you are maintaining a positive savings position, this is below the recommended 20% savings threshold. Consider reviewing your expenses to identify areas where you might reduce spending to increase your savings rate. With your current segments (professional hustlers, prudent planners), you may benefit from creating a more detailed budget to help prioritize savings goals and build a stronger financial cushion over time.

**4. Recommendations**
# Recommendations:

1. **Maintain Your Positive Cash Flow**: You're spending 88.96% of your income, which leaves a small positive margin. Consider increasing this buffer to at least 15-20% for greater financial security.

2. **Evaluate Bills Payment Strategy**: With 87% of your spending going to bills payments, look for opportunities to reduce fixed expenses or negotiate better rates with service providers.

3. **Create a Dedicated Emergency Fund**: As a prudent planner, allocate a portion of your monthly surplus to build a 3-6 month emergency fund to reduce reliance on loan services.

4. **Diversify Income Sources**: With 25% of your cash-in coming from loan services, work toward increasing other income streams to reduce dependency on borrowed funds.

5. **Track QR Payment Discretionary Spending**: While your QR payments are relatively small (12.5% of spending), continue monitoring these transactions to ensure they align with your financial goals as a prudent planner.
