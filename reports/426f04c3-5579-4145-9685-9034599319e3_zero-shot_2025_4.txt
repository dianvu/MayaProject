# Financial Recommendations

Based on your recent transaction activity, here are some personalized recommendations to improve your financial health:

1. **Create a balanced budget** - Your spending exceeds your cash-in by 54.22%. Try tracking your expenses in categories and aim to reduce your spending to match your income.

2. **Build an emergency fund** - Consider setting aside 10-15% of your cash-in amounts to create a safety net for unexpected expenses, which would help reduce the need to overspend.

3. **Diversify your cash-in methods** - You're currently relying solely on "send money" for income. Explore additional income streams or payment methods to create more financial stability.

4. **Set up automatic savings** - Schedule small automatic transfers to a savings account each time you receive money to build savings without having to think about it.

5. **Review frequent small transactions** - Your multiple small "pay with maya" and "qr" transactions may indicate impulse spending. Consider consolidating these purchases to reduce overall spending.
