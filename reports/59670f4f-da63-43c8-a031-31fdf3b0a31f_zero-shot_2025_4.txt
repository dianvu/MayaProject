**4. Recommendations**
# Financial Recommendations

Based on your recent transaction history, here are some personalized recommendations to improve your financial health:

1. **Consider a savings plan** - You've only spent about 27% of your cash-in amount this month, which is excellent. Consider automatically transferring a portion of your remaining balance to a dedicated savings account to build an emergency fund or save toward specific goals.

2. **Explore investment options** - With your prudent spending habits, you might benefit from exploring low-risk investment options for some of your unused funds. Even small investments can grow significantly over time.

3. **Track your QR spending categories** - All your transactions were made via QR code. Consider using a budgeting app to categorize these expenses (groceries, entertainment, etc.) to better understand your spending patterns and identify potential areas for optimization.

4. **Set up automatic transfers** - Since you made a single large bank transfer at the beginning of the month, consider setting up smaller, automatic weekly transfers to better manage your cash flow and reduce the temptation of having a large balance available.

5. **Review subscription services** - As a hobbyist, check if any of your QR payments were for subscription services. Evaluate which ones truly align with your interests and consider canceling those you don't regularly use.
