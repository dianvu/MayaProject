# Recommendations:

1. **Maintain Your Positive Cash Flow**: You're spending only 63% of your income, which is excellent. Continue this disciplined approach to build financial security.

2. **Diversify Payment Methods**: All your transactions use send money. Consider using other payment methods like QR or direct payments for better tracking and potential rewards.

3. **Create Gaming Budget**: As part of the gaming segment, allocate a specific portion of your income for gaming expenses to ensure this hobby remains financially sustainable.

4. **Establish Loan Repayment Strategy**: Since you're in the loan segment, prioritize creating a structured repayment plan that fits within your current positive cash flow.

5. **Build Emergency Savings**: Channel some of your monthly surplus (approximately 37% of income) into an emergency fund until you reach 3-6 months of essential expenses.

6. **Track Transaction Purposes**: All your transactions show as "send money" - consider labeling or categorizing these transfers to gain better visibility into your spending patterns.
