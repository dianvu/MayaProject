**4. Recommendations**
# Financial Recommendations

Based on your April 2025 transaction patterns, here are some personalized recommendations to improve your financial health:

1. **Create a dedicated savings plan** - You're currently spending about 63% of your cash inflows, which is good. Consider automatically transferring 15-20% of incoming funds to a separate savings account to build an emergency fund or save toward specific goals.

2. **Track your "send money" transactions** - All your transactions are categorized as "send money." Consider using more specific payment methods or labels to better track where your money is going, which will help with budgeting.

3. **Establish a gaming budget** - As someone in the gaming segment, consider setting a specific monthly allowance for gaming-related expenses to ensure this hobby remains financially sustainable.

4. **Explore loan refinancing options** - Since you're in the loan segment, review your current loan terms to see if refinancing could reduce your interest rates or monthly payments, potentially freeing up more money for savings.

5. **Continue your prudent planning** - Your spending-to-income ratio shows you're already making careful financial decisions. Consider working with a financial advisor to develop a comprehensive long-term financial plan that aligns with your goals.
